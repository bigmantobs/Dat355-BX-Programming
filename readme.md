# DAT355 Bidirectional Transitions Exercise 6.
I struggled quite heavily with this exercise, and am unsure if the conclusion I came to is anywhere similar to what we are intended to do. My apologies in advance for this.

## Identify some cases (of forward or backward propagation), in which an automatic consistency restoration is possible.
In the cases with the special authors, it would have been possible to restore consistency automatically, as there are only so many types of books each author would write.

## Also identify at least one case, where no unique propagation is possible. How should the application behave in this case?
One case where consistency checking would fail is if there is a ":" in the book title, as this is where we were instructed to concact/split strings in the stringpairs.

Put-put law?
